Have you ever worked as a part-timer? These days, university students should choice a part time job because the students can't be supported their studying and living expenses by their parents. Moreover, Korean universities have been increasing their tuitions year after year. Though university students should concentrate on their studying, they can't study well. Sometimes, they absent from school because they worked very hard last night. But if you can't avoid it, how about enjoy it? I have some advice about part time jobs as a senior. First, get a job which you really interested in. If your dream is a diplomat, you should consider working in a company that using English. It is painful that someone working in a not-wanted job. For example, I've worked in an English institution as a teacher of elementary students. And it has given me friendships with foreign friends and English skills. Second, do your job as you are a professional. There will be not a person who doesn't like hard-working people. You can meet some friends who will help you. If you work hard, it will be helpful not only for your benefit, but also for your image. Working is hard, but the fruits are sweet. You can think you are unhappy because you should be working when your wealthy friend is playing. But part-time job is not just for money. You will have many chances during the working hour: recognizing the mind of your parents, rewarding of job and value for money.
