Is part-time job important for students? Today, many college students have part-time job for several reasons. I think it is very important for their college lives to have part-time job for the following reasons. Firstly, they can have experience on society before they graduate their college. Through the part-time job, they can learn business manner and communication skill with others as the society requests. Secondly, they can live independently by having part-time job. They can earn some money for their college tuition and their own leisure life without their parents' help, and also, they can buy something they have wanted. Lastly, it is a very good opportunity for college students to think about their parents' efforts for them. From birth to high school, most of them have been given their parents' money and efforts. Through the part-time job, they finally know the fact that they parents earn money in a different way. For these reasons, I totally agree that it is very important for college students to have part-time job. They can get valuable things through part-time job.
