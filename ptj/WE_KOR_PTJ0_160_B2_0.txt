I truly agree with the topic. Our life is too short to study only. We are too young and beautiful to be captured in a school for studying and studying again. I know that studying is a very important job as a student, but we had already been studying for so long. There are so many things to do outside of school. Experiences from the past will make a person who he or she is. I think we need to experience as many things as possible, and experiences will help us when we have the same kind of problems in the future. Our parents have supported us financially so far. We are now at the age of being able to take responsibility on our own. We can make money for our phone bills and allowances. However, I highly recommend you to find appropriate work, try different jobs and study hard. First, if we work at a bar or a convenient store at very late night until morning, then it won't be helpful for us. Second, if we try different types of jobs in four years, experiencing types of work must be somewhat help you to find the perfect job when you need to get a job for a living in the future. If we work too hard, we might be neglectful when it comes to studying. Let's not forget that we are students. We need to step further to enjoy our school life and be a better person by having a part-time job. Do everything as long as you can. We can be an independent individual and a good-graded student at the same time.
