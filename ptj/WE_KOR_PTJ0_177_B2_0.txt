Many students are having part time jobs these days. It became one of the cultures among young people. They work at caf辿, fast food store, a convenient store and so on. Mostly the reason they look for part time jobs is to earn money because there are many things they want to buy in twenties. But some other says that having a part time is an important experience to learn a real world. I don't agree with that. It might be helpful if a student has a part time job just for a month. One month is enough time to learn how hard earning money is or how tough this world is. But if the student works for a long time, I think that is the time to have problems. The works they do is usually mere work not professional. They easily get tired compare to others who don't have a part time job and it also influence their grades. I think school grades, traveling, chasing dream are the things truly important to young people. There are so many thing they should care bating part time jobs. I think if you want to experience the world, an intern ship would be better than a part time job.
