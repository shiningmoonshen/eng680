I think it is necessary for college students to have a part time job, because these kinds of experience give student to valuable moments which learn about many things. There are several reasons to support my idea. First of all, students learn the importance of money, and they take care of money far better than before. Because through doing part-time job, they learn that it is really hard for them to make money. So they learn the value of money which they have spent very uselessly. Secondly, part-time job would give students to diverse social experiences. They have to learn how to hang out their boss in the office, and how to treat their customers by doing part-time job. Thus, they finally learn the real world which is very different from the comfortable world in the school. These kinds of experiences are very useful for them to work at the office after graduating the college. In conclusion, I strongly support the idea that it is better for college students to have a part time job. Not only it can give students to realize the importance of the money, but also it can make students to experience real social world which is very different from the school word.
