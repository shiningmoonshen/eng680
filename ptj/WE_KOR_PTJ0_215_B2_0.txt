Most college students in Korea do not have enough money to use in their daily life. Because college students do not work in a company, they just get money from their parents. As they get money from their parents, they can be uncomfortable about spending money. However, it is not good for them to get money from their parents because they are adults. They have a duty that they have to make money by themselves as adults. So, I want to suggest to college students that they have to get a part-time job to make money by them selves. Part-time job is good way to make money even though they are not graduated from their school. Part- time job can make people earn money not giving up their study. Also, there is another good point of doing part-time job. If college students do the part-time job, they can feel economical society prior to getting a job. When they get a job, they may have problems that they have not experienced before. However, they can manage to do their job, if they have ever experienced the social life before. Doing part-time job will be their precious experience that makes them endures their problems with the company in the future.
