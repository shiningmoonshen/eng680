Some people might hastily say that only attending a university is the easiest and fastest way to live a successful life because a college education is the surest method that guarantees one's success. However, I am convinced that having a part-time job is desirable for college students. Because it can develop your practical skills and experience what is society. To begin with, you can improve your practical skills necessary for a successful career earlier instead of wasting four or more years in college. In Korea, most college students, including soon-to-be graduates, are unfamiliar with practical work skills necessary when they start a job. The reason is that they focus mainly on theoretical knowledge while attending college. Moreover, by having a part-time job, students can save a lot of time and money that can play a role in a person's success. College students have to spend four or more years only studying at school without earning any money. In addition to spending a long time as a student, they have to spend a huge amount of money on expensive tuition and college life, such as taking trips to overseas countries during summer or winter vacations. However, if they have a part-time job they could save enough time and money to become successful. They can save up a certain amount of money each month for stocks and housing investment or work abroad a long time to have various work experiences. In this respect, getting a part-time job seems to be a wise decision for students. In conclusion, for the above reasons. I strongly agree with the statement that it is important for college students to have a part-time job.
