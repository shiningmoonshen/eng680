I agree that college students have a part time job. There are some reasons. First, students who have a part time job can help support a family. These days the college tuition fees and food expenses are growing. Parents' worries and sigh are also growing. If students have a part time job and earn their pocket money, they could aid family finances. Next, It can help increase experiences and careers to work part time job. Most people get a job after they graduated from the school. If we have a experience about part time job, when we get a job we can easily adapt ourselves to place of work. Finally, we can know the value of money. Give an example. I receive allowance from my parents. Because they give me pocket money on a weekly basis, I don't feel well the shortage of money. So I tend to spend all money if money exists. Therefore, college students who get a allowance lavish their money on everything since they don't make money. But, college students who have a part time job know the value of money and use money frugally. Like this there are many adventages of part time job. Although side effects of it exist, I hope that students wii be independent through working a part time job.
