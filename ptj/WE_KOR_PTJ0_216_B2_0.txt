I think that it is very important for college student to do some part time jobs. At this age, they are not just a baby of their parents anymore. They are not also just students of the school anymore who can't do his or her own works alone. As a college student, they have to prepare for their independent life when graduating from the school. Therefore, they have to learn how to earn the money to sustain their lives themselves. To be sure, all the money that needs to sustain lives can't be earned by part time job but at least they have to earn their allowance themselves. In addition, parents will not worry about their living when they become an independent worker in the society. Some people can say that they are still students so they have to concentrate on their study for the future job and life. However, if they can plan their schedule appropriately to gain both money and knowledge, they will be successful not only on their money but also on their job. In real, most of the college students are doing two those things nowadays. If those who are not experienced enough to work for money in their college life, they will feel difficult easily when they are alone in the society.
