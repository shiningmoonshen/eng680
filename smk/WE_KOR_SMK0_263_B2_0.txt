There are many debates about smoking, but a debate if smoking should be allowed in public areas is the most controversial these days. Many restaurants have adopted the idea of separating seats according to smoking, but there are still people who want smoking bannned completely in restaurants. I agree that smoking should be forbidden at all the restaurants in the name of law. First of all, it is said that secondhand smoking causes more serious health problems, . Especially, the effects towards pregnant women and young babies are disastrous. According to several statistics, the chance of suffering from lung cancer is higher if nonsmokers breathe in smoke. Who is going to compensate this person's health? Would smokers do that for non-smokers? Definitely not. Legal methods are needed to decrease the dangers of secondhand smoking. The second reason is that smoke can make people lose appetitie. Even though the seats are separated in restaurants, the smell can spreadout through the air. For instance, a man ordered a steak and he is about to have that one delicious bite. Then suddenly, a person at the next table started smoking. . The smoke eventually comes to their table so the smell distracts them from eating their meal. People say smoking in places they want are smokers' rights. What about the rights of non-smokers then? The best way to protect these two sides is to ban smoking in restaurants completely in the country and to build places solely for smoking.
