I agree with the statement that smoking should be completely banned at all restaurants in the country. Smoking in the restaurants is very harmful and indeed almost disgusting to non-smokers because restaurant is a place where people eat and enjoy their meals. When inhaling smoking in the restaurant, the people's taste for food as well as their enjoying of the meal will be disgusted. Many non-smokers get much harm from smokers in the streets and restaurants. The second-hand smoking is more dangerous than first-hand smoking, especially for women and children. If children are exposed to smoking from their early ages, there is a higher chance for them to grow to become smokers. Moreover, banning smoking at all the restaurants in the country can be the first step to lower the smoking rate in countries. It is important to make the settings as inconvenient as possible for smokers, because if there is much convenience for smokers, more people will turn out to become smokers. In addition, banning smoking in as many places as possible including all the restaurants will reduce air pollution caused by smoking. Although banning may seem like a little choice, its effect will be tremendous; thus bringing many positive effects to the lives of people as well as to the environment.
