I agree that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country. I have some reasons why I support the statement. A restaurant is a place where people have a meal. Most of customers want to enjoy the meal with the smells of foods. But the cigarette smoke may prevent it. And there may be a lot of children and seniors in a restaurant. In this situation, cigarette smoke can be irritated and uncomfortable to non-smokers. And even it is harmful for children and seniors to breathe air with cigarette smoke. Smoking in a enclosed place with a lot of people such as a restaurant causes secondhand smoke. Secondhand smoke is more harmful than smoking. Cigarette smoke that smokers blow out is more dangerous than that of smokers breathing. And this phenomenon can worsen in an enclosed place such as restaurant. I think it is unfair that non-smokers who don't want to damage their body and pursue pleasure ruin their health because of cigarette smoke. For these reasons, I think smoking should be prohibited at all the restaurants and it should be broaden to all public places such as bus stops, parks, concert hall and so on.
