I don't think that smoking should be completely banned at all restaurants in the country. However, I would like to assume that it should be banned restrictively. I agree with a basic premise in the phrase but a complete prohibition at all restaurants seems harsh for those smokers. As I said before, smoking should be limited in indoor places, because smoking invades many people's rights to be healthy. That is, smoking is bad for damaging other people. Especially in restaurants, as it is a closed place, it could directly harm the atmosphere. Moreover, it could spoil many people's appetite while they eat food. Most importantly, there are many research findings about a danger of smoking for neighbors as well as the person. Therefore, as smoking itself is not a proper thing for human, we need a certain approach to be free from an influence of smoking. On the contrary, we need to think the smoker's right as well. Of course, this consideration should be put in terms of freedom. Therefore, if they do not damage other people in restaurants, smoking would be allowed. For example, like a closed space for smokers in coffee shops, if there are such a place in restaurants, the right to smoke would be secured. However, this kind of place in restaurants seems uncommon unlike a case of coffee shops in many countries. As a result, we have to find a method to protect a right of both non-smokers and smokers as far as possible.
