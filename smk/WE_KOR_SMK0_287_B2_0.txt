First of all, it's bad for smoker as well as non-smoker's health in anywhere. These days, health care is very important issue. In addition, we know that indirect smoking is even more dangerous than direct smoking from many advertising or media. For example smoking causes lung cancer. It can cause the other cancers enough. Why do people (especially non-smokers) get damage because of smoking? There's no good point. Smoking and cigarette have only bad points. That is same thing to waste money. And in all the restaurants, clean is the most important thing. Cooks deal with materials for food in restaurants' kitchen. If the kitchen isn't clean for smoking when they cook some foods, foods go bad easily. Hurt foods make people get a disease. Food poisoning is a good example. Of course this disease is caused frequently by the other reasons. However smoke caused by smoking can be also the reason of that. Also, Interior (or environment) in the restaurant is damaged by misty and bad smelling smoke. Human has an effect on an atmosphere. When people enter a restaurant being misty because of smoking, they will feel uncomfortable or unpleasant. Maybe they go out at once and search other restaurant that is clean and pleasant.
