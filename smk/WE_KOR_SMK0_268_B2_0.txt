I think it is extreme to ban smoking completely at all the restaurants in the country. I also don't like people smoking in the restaurants but smokers have the right to smoke. If we ban smoking in the restaurants, it means smokers have little place to smoke while eating. It also means that the restaurants smokers can eat freely decrease. Some people think smokers can smoke outside the restaurant and smokers can tolerate smoking while eating but for smokers it can be a torture not to smoke. Non-smokers have a right to eat in fresh environment but I think smokers have the right to smoke, too. I think if there are some places for smokers in the restaurants, it can be helpful. It is good for both non-smokers and smokers. Smokers can smoke in the smoking only places and non-smokers can enjoy the meal in fresh air. For example, I went to coffee-bean café with my friend one day and there was a smoking place in the cafe. I could enjoy my time without smokes from cigarettes and smokers smoked in that place. I think it is good way to consider both sides- non-smokers and smokers. Instead of banning smoking completely, I think by making smoking areas in the restaurants can be one solution.
