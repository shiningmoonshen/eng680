I believe that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country. I have three reasons to back up my opinion. First, what is a restaurant for? It is, of course, a place where people go to eat. Because of that simple fact, it is obvious that a restaurant needs to be extra cleaner than other places. It has to be sanitary for all customers' health. However, if smokers are allowed to smoke at a restaurant, there will be smoke and ashes everywhere and it will create a horrible atmosphere to enjoy a pleasant meal. Second, smokers need to think of other people around them. They came to the restaurant to enjoy delicious food and have a good time with the people who came together. They did not come to the restaurant to inhale secondhand smoke and cough. It is a very rude and selfish act to do. Other smokers might say it is okay to smoke, but other non-smokers would certainly say NO to smoking. Lastly, smoking is bad for the smokers' health. They are harming the bodies of not only other people but also themselves. They should not smoke at the restaurants. They also should not smoke at hospitals, schools, offices, and even at home. They should quit smoking for their own benefit. Anyone can see from these three reasons that smoking should be prohibited at all the restaurants in the country.
