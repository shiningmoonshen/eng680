Smoking should be banned at restaurants but there need to be an exception. I'm a non-smoker and I hate the people smoking in the streets or in the public places. However, I can't argue to ban smoking at all restaurants. There are rights for both smokers and non-smokers. So we need to respect both, and the resolution should be good for both parties. Therefore, every restaurant should have a separate smoking area. Until now, there are smoking and non-smoking area but they're not separated that even at non-smoking area, there are possibilities for people to have a second hand smoking. It means to intrude the right of non-smoker so we need a separate place for them. Maybe some people would claim just to ban the smoking for the sake. However, smoking is also one of habits and one's own decision and we're living in a democratic country. Therefore, the nation has right to let them know about the danger of smoking, but doesn't have any right to limit one's freedom. We need to respect the smoker's rights, too. Also, pubs and bars are also a kind of restaurants, and if we ban the smoking in all restaurants in the country, it'll lose their culture. Many people who go to pubs and bars are trying to enjoy the drinking, smoking and the relationship among people. If we ban it, these pubs' and bars' culture would be imbalanced. We just let them be like recent days.
