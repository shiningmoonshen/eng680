Some people argue that we should not completely ban smoking at all the restaurants. They say that it violates the human freedom right. However, I disagree with this argument because if human right is important, we should also respect other people's right to be healthy as well as our own right of freedom. Above all, I oppose to the idea that we should allow people to smoke anywhere including public areas because it is the same as the behavior to make other people's health worse. According to recent studies, the indirect smoking – breathing cigarette smoke – is as dangerous as the direct smoking. In other words, there are considerable possibilities that the indirect smoking causes lung cancer in the same way as that of the direct smoking. Therefore, smoking in public areas can increase the rate of cancer in a society. In contrast, some people say that banning smoking in certain places violates the freedom right. Although their arguments make sense, we should remember that it is also important to respect other people's right; that is, the right to maintain good health. If someone wants to smoke despite the dangerousness of smoking, they can choose other ways to smoke like smoking in their private areas, or the places where smoking is allowed. In other words, they do not have the right to make other people's health worse by smoking at the restaurants. In conclusion, taking into account the dangerousness of indirect smoking, it should be banned to smoke in public places like restaurants. Even though the private freedom to smoke should be also respected, the smokers can choose alternatives to smoke in their private places, not public ones. There is no doubt in that we should respect other people's right to maintain good heath before claiming our own freedom right.
