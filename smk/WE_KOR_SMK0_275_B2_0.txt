I think it shouldn't be completely banned. It should not completely but selectively banned. Above all, I am also a person who likes smoking after having some meals, finishing something, and having some coffee, but it is usually banned in most of restaurants except for pubs, or bar. It is certain that non-smokers don't want to be with smokers who are smoking, and indirect smoking is more harmful than direct smoking. I understand it as well. However, smoker's rights of smoking in public area also exist. Because cigarettes are also products which tobacco company wants to sell customer, and customers want to use it anywhere despite of in public area. Additionally, governments should provide them some smoking districts in public area, because taxes of cigarettes are so high. In other words, Heavy smokers are very sincere large taxpayer. So I'll suggest a solution. We divide the restaurants into two areas such as smoking area and non-smoking area. When smokers are with smokers in smoking area, they would feel comfortable if they smoke. It is the possible situation smokers don't like the smoking smell; however, they are more understandable than non-smokers. If we do like that, we didn't argue about this topic again. I think it is the best solution which is considering both smoker and non-smoker.
