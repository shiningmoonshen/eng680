I think smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country. Smoking attacks not only firsthand smokers but also secondhand smokers so at public places like restaurants smokers should avoid smoke. Penalty by government is the most efficient way to have smokers keep social rule. Here are some reasons for this opinion. First, smoking brings bad influence to people even though they are in the same place with firsthand smoker. Restaurants are not a personal place but a public area so many people from young baby to seniors are using. In this place, we should think of other people's health. Second, as we all know the fact that smoking has a lot of bad aspects but, it is very difficult to quit smoke by oneself. I think the public ban is the most efficient way to help them be more careful. I am not saying that all smokers must give up smoking but they should avoid public place, and putting penalty will helpful. For those reasons I strongly say that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country. First, in the public place, smokers have duty not to influence them badly. Second, putting economic penalty is the best way to help them regard the proper place to smoke.
