I agree that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country. First, smoking is bad for not only smoker's health but also non smoker's. Cigarette is composed of many damaging materials such as nicotine, tar and carbon monoxide. Smoke is also very harmful. It causes serious disease like lung cancer. If a man smoke in the restaurant, it can damage for many people through the air and food. It is unfair that many people including non smokers take harm because of some smokers. Next, non smokers get bad feeling by smoking. Restaurant is naturally a pleasant place where people go to eat delicious food and talk with their family, friends and lover. But this nice mood can be changed immediately by smoke. In my case I have a headache for smoke although I was in good feeling and it is very stressful. Last, smoking can cause fire. Remains after smoking are often just dropped on the floor. It is quite dangerous. Many fire accident occurred by the remains. I know recently several restaurants separate a nonsmoking section from smoking section. However I think it is not enough. It can't block whole. So I agree above statement.
