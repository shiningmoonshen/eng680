In today's world, it has been debated whether Smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants or not. Some restaurants regulate smoking for many reasons. Other restaurants just separate smoking zone from non-smoking zone. I disagree smoking should be banned at all the restaurants for 2 reasons. One of my reasons is that people have to have freedom. And it depends on country as to what they violate. People over 19 can buy cigaretts anywhere, so they have right to smoke anywhere. Of cousrse, I am non-smoker. However, my father who somke cigaretts often told me that cigaretts helped him lower his stress level. Likewise, some of them feel relax when they smoke. So we don't have any right for them not to smoke. So it should be legal to smoke anywhere, of course, under the restriction that you have to be over 19. Second, there is a best way not to infringe the rights of each other. The way is that restaurants separate smoking zone from non-smoking zone and give right to do something. I think it is generally agreed that an individual's rights extend so far as they do not infringe the rights of another. To summarize, smoking at restaurants should be legal to reserve right to do and people should have the right to smoke.
