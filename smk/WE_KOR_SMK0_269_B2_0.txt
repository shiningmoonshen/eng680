These days, there are a lot of concerns about banning smoking in public areas. Of course, everyone has their own right to smoke whenever and wherever they want. However, I want to point out that smoking should be totally prohibited in all the restaurants without any exception in every country. There are two main reasons for this argument: secondhand smoking is very harmful and atmosphere is very important for those who visit restaurants for their dining. First, it is undeniable that a secondhand smoke is more harmful than smoking to smokers themselves. Since 1970s, there have been a number of researches about troubles which smoking results in. The most serious problem is that smoking cause a lot of unhealthiness even to those who do not smoke at all. Moreover, since children do not have strong immune system, this harmfulness would be more problematic to them. Also, public area where many people dine together at the same time, the trouble from smoking would be far bigger than other places. In addition, people who visit restaurant have also right to enjoy their meal in great atmosphere. There is one saying: people buy its atmosphere as well as food. I think this explains how important the mood of restaurants is. In one of the surveys, over than half people answered that they consider atmosphere most when they decide where to eat. In conclusion, banning smoking in all restaurants in all country is very reasonable in that smoking has many problems to the public and restaurants should be the places for people to enjoy their meal.
