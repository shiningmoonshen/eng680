I think that smoking should be completely prohibited at all restaurants in the country because smoking in a restaurant can harm other non-smokers. In restaurants there is no division between smoking area and non-smoking area. That is a problem. There may be someone who has to avoid cigarette smoke, but it is impossible in current situation. In addition, generally non-smokers hate to be exposure to cigarette smoke, and of course it is not good for health. So current trend is to make smoking area and allow smoke only in the area. Nowadays many buildings have those areas. I have many friends who smoke, and according to my observation and their words, smokers usually do not smoke during having a meal. They smoke after having a meal. So actually there is no reason to smoke in a restaurant during a meal intentionally. They can smoke after a meal, outside of the restaurant. So I think that it will be fine that banning smoking in restaurants. I know that smoking is not illegal but just individual's choice so smokers have freedom to smoke. However, I think that smoking area and non-smoking area should be distinguished for both smokers and non-smokers. Most of coffee shop has divided area now. I think that at least restaurants should follow the trend if they allow to smoke in restaurant because they must consider non-smokers and not to harm them.
