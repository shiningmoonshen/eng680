I agree with the smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in country. This way is not respect for smoker. Smoker have a free of smoking. And we have not right to take away smoker's freedom. But the freedom need to responsibility. Smokeing is very not good our health. Smoke is very not good for health not only smoker but also non smoker. Smoking causes lung cancer and any other disease. If one smoker smoking in the restaurants, all the people in the restaurants are get a damage. Once the health is poor, then it is very hard to return to good. So smoker is not responsible at the smoking's damage. If the smoker have a lot of money, the health is don't change the money. And the smoking when you eating something is very unpleasent. So if you eating very delicious food where the smoker is smoking in restaurants, you not taste the food well. You will think just get off the smoking spot. I think the damage of non smokers is bigger then the discomfortable of the smokers. So the smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants. Although they have discomfortable on the restaurants.
