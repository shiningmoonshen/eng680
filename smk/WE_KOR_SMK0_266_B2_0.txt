I agree to the claim which requires smoking to be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country. I feel sorry for smokers who really want to smoke at restaurants, but they should be banned by a strict law. They will argue that they have a right to smoke at their will by quoting'natural liberty', or'civil liberties', but although those rights are invaluable they cannot help the smokers in this case. Those rights can be accepted only if the person doesn't harm anyone or anything when do something but, as everyone knows, smoking really does harm not only to one's health but to other's health. Recently a research by a group of scientists proved indirect smoking is much more dangerous as it can cause some kinds of cancer, and many newspapers reported it. Thus, smoking should be banned in public places, and restaurants, particularly, are the place where people enjoy their meal and conversation so they should be under special control of smoking. In other words, smokers can't evade from the responsibility for other's health and they should know other people also have their right to eat in a clean and safe atmosphere. Smokers can live without a mealtime smoking, but others are dying if they smoke.
