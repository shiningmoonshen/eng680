Smoking at all the restaurants in the country should be banned. Some people insist that people have their freedom to smoke. However, I believe smoking in public places violates other people's freedom to enjoy their meals and is harmful for others' health. First of all, people cannot enjoy their meals at the restaurants when other people next to them smoke. When I went to the restaurants, there were two people who smoked in the restaurants. I felt I was smoking as the smell was very severe. Therefore, I just finished my dinner as soon as possible even though the meal was with my friend who I had not seen for a long time. Some people insist that the freedom to enjoy smoking is important. However, if their freedom hinders others' freedom, the freedom should be limited. Second, indirect smoking is more dangerous. According to a survey, when a person smokes, it is worse for the health of other people around him or her. Restaurants are places that every people can come including the elder people, the pregnant, and babies. People cannot do harm on others' health by emphasizing their freedom to smoke. Therefore, smoking should be banned in public places, including restaurants.
