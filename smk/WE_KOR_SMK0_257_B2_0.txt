In our society, there are several rules people should obey. Certain situations often strongly forbid some acts, for the public good. On this matter, some might think that an individual's free will should be respected before the community's. However, I think happiness from the free will is not separated from the public good and I believe that smoking should be completely banned at all restaurants in the country for the following main reasons. First, 'smoke' is gas. It flows through the air. Therefore, smoking can produce'the second smoker', non-smokers but people who get harmful effects because of nearby smokers. It is obviously 'evil'. In addition, it can evoke more serious results than smokers simply expected. The place 'restaurant' has a specific meaning which implies something unique. In the restaurant, people open their mouth for eating and speaking. Then smoke can go into not only people's nose but also their mouth. If a person smokes in the restaurant, customers feel bad and it makes them not want to go there anymore. Then it can be 'a bullet in the gun' which triggers the failure of the restaurant business. As a result, smokers who frequently go to the restaurant cannot go there anymore. Smoking at public places is just a momentary and short-sighted pleasure which makes harmful effect on society.
