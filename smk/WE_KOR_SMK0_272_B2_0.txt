When I, non smoker, am eating food in a restaurant, some smokers annoyed my meal. Smell, and smoke from smoking was difficult for non smoker to keep eating food. Many restaurants have a separate place for smokers but smell and smoke still influence on other people's eating. Also, if smokers eat food in a separate place, they are directly exposed to smoke, so it is very harmful to them. Therefore, smoking should be completely banned in restaurants. Also, smoking is not limited problem to eating. It is bad for people. However, if restaurants accept people to smoke, the reason why smokers should stop smoking is reduced. For example, In Singapore, it is banned to smoke in any street. After making this policy, the number of smokers reduced. Like Singapore, if it is banned to smoke in public places, the number of smokers will be reduced. Therefore, to ban smoking in restaurants have effects on reducing smokers. Especially, restaurants are important place to be cleaned. A little amount of dust or ash should not be discovered in any restaurant. However, if restaurants accept smoking there, the ash will spread in the place, so this is bad for hygiene of a restaurant.
