I strongly support the banning of smoking at all the restaurants in the country. When I go on the street, I saw some people who smoke. Smokers have freedom to smoke. So outside of the public room, non-smokers cannot criticize them. But I dislike smoke very much. In spite of the moment of walking on the street for the short time, I feel very uncomfortable and hateful to that smoke. This is the reason why at that time I run fast stuffing my nose and mouth. In the reastant the smoke can be much more sensitive. Because smoking can interefere the clear environment of restaurant where we have a good time eating the delicious food. On top of that, the food can be polluted by the smoke chemicals. Therefore, smokers have to keep the public courtesy in the restaurant. If we have to respect the smokers in the restaurant, it is good idea to make the smoke-room in there. Smoke-room is only the place where smokers can be in. On the reason that they smoke one another, they can not be careful of smoke, Smoking is allowed in that space. In this way, smoke-room can be solution to respect the smokers in the restaurant. Were it not for that smoke-room, smokers can rigidly follow the rule that they must not smoke. The scientific research shows that indirect smoke are harmful to the health. Smokers can have a bad influence of the nonsmokers as well as themselves. They have to be careful because we are the member of the community.
