Should smoking be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country? I think that smoking should be banned in restaurants in all countries. Firstly it is because smoking is not only bad for smoking peoples' health but also other's. I heard that there are 15 harmful substances in tobacco and it is also bad for second-hand smoking people. Secondly, it makes some people's appetite drop. I also have experiences that I couldn't enjoy my dishes because of odd smells from smoking people. And smoking in restaurants encroaches the rights for ordinary people to eat foods in clean place. Of course smoking people also have rihgts to smoke in some places but it shouldn't encroach others' rights. To be fair to the two sides of people, I think the restaurant should divide smoking and non-smoking room definitely. However, in usual restaurants it isn't kept perfectly so non-smoking rooms also smell disgusty. If restaurants can separate the room, they don't need to ban smoking people. But they can't, I think the definite law that smoking isn't permitted in restaurants should be made.
